# Formik Task

This project is a simple React application that manages a collection of books. It provides a user interface for navigating between different pages such as the home page, viewing books, creating a new book entry, and editing an existing book entry. The project uses `react-router-dom` for routing between these pages and `formik` with `yup` for form state management and validation.

## App Component

The `App` component is the root component of the application. It sets up the routing for the application using `react-router-dom`.

### Explanation

- **State Management**: The `App` component uses a state variable `id` to store the ID of the book that is being edited. This state is managed using the `useState` hook.
- **Navigation**: The `Nav` component is included at the top to provide navigation links for the application.
- **Routes**:
  - `/` (Home Page): Renders the `Home` component.
  - `/books` (Books Page): Renders the `Books` component and passes the `setId` function as a prop to allow setting the `id` state from within the `Books` component.
  - `/edit/:id` (Edit Page): Renders the `Edit` component and passes the `id` state as a prop to allow editing a specific book.
  - `/create` (Create Page): Renders the `Create` component for adding a new book.

## Components

- **Nav**: Provides navigation links for the different pages of the application.
- **Home**: A simple component that acts as the landing page.
- **Books**: Displays a list of books. This component can update the `id` state in the `App` component to indicate which book is being edited.
- **Create**: A form for creating a new book entry with validation using `formik` and `yup`.
- **Edit**: A form for editing an existing book entry with validation using `formik` and `yup`, using the `id` prop passed from the `App` component.

## Usage

1. **Home Page**: Navigate to the home page by visiting `/`.
2. **View Books**: Navigate to `/books` to see a list of all books. You can select a book to edit, which sets the `id` state in the `App` component.
3. **Edit Book**: Navigate to `/edit/:id` to edit a specific book. The `id` parameter is used to fetch and display the book's details for editing.
4. **Create Book**: Navigate to `/create` to add a new book to the list.

## Conclusion

This application demonstrates basic navigation, state management, and form validation in a React application using `react-router-dom` and `formik` with `yup`. It can be extended with additional features such as form validation, API integration, and more advanced state management as needed.
